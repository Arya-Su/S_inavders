I haven't enjoyed a project as much as this one in a long time. Of course, thanks to Tim Ruscica, I managed to understand the programming logic of this classic game. The changes I made are, traditionally, related to the visual part of the game. Also, I added background music and a music effect when pressing the button to shoot. Also, I chose the standard arrows for ship movement instead of the letters a,w, s, and d that Tim put in. During the creation and practice of this project, I learned a lot, made a large number of mistakes that I solved myself, and again, I learned the most from my own mistakes. Maybe someday instead of classic "pixel" ships, I will add ships from Star Wars, but right now I don't want to waste time making adequate pictures.
